    <h1>Rapid Response to COVID-19</h1>
    <h2>The Youth Project still reamins an important service in Melbourne during to COVID-19</h2>
    <p>With a growing number of services closing across the city, we are experiencing increased pressures to continue keeping our doors open and health services accessible for people experiencing homelessness. </p>

    <P>When COVID-19 first emerged, Youth Projects activated their pandemic action plan and were able to remain open by working safely and effectively, helping the most vulnerable and high-risk people in Melbourne. Our services surged in demand and we became a central point for many people with health care and daily needs.</p>
<p>On average, we have been seeing 100 people each day, providing support to almost 3,900 individuals through our health services alone.</p>

<p>We delivered 2,250 GP and nursing contacts, providing 880 mental health episodes of care, supplied 11,000 food packs and nutritious meals and more than 2,300 showers and loads of laundry  during the first six months of crisis. We were able to give crisis accommodation to 200 people and provided on--site COVID-19 testing. </p>
